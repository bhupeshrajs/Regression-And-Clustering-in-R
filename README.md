# Regression-And-Clustering-in-R

The idea of the project is to implement these 4 algorithms : 
  1. Linear Regression 
  2. Logistic Regression 
  3. k-means Clustering 
  4. Hierarchial Clustering
  
After the implementation, I analyze the performance of these algorithms against the inbuilt 
  functions present for the same algorithms in R for a given dataset.
